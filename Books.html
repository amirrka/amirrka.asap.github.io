It is based on Covey's notion that our perceptions of the world are totally based on our own. We must change ourselves in order to alter a circumstance, and we must be able to modify our views in order to change ourselves.</p>

                                <p>Influence: Science and Practice is a psychology book that looks at the various ways that "Compliance Professionals" might influence individuals. Robert B. Cialdini, a professor of psychology at Arizona State University, is the book's author. The book's central assumption is that in a complicated world where individuals are bombarded with more information than they can handle, people resort to making decisions based on generalizations. These generalizations emerge as a result of the fact that they help individuals to perform correctly with a minimum of effort and time. Those who are aware of them, on the other hand, might use them as weapons to persuade others to act in specific ways. In the most current iteration, a seventh lever on "unity" was included.</p>

                                <p>Dad is a wealthy man. Poor Dad is about Robert Kiyosaki and his two fathers—his biological father (poor dad) and the father of his closest friend (rich dad)—and how both men influenced his financial and investment views. He claims that his impoverished father received a Ph.D. at Stanford and that his wealthy father never completed eighth grade. The book is divided into eight chapters, each with a lesson that everyone should learn. Kiyosaki's main message is that you don't have to make a lot of money to be wealthy.</p>

                                <p>Hideyoshi, a peasant lad, dreamed of becoming a samurai at a period of infinite turmoil and murder, when the only law was the law of the sword. Despite his small stature and lack of power, he managed to outthink and outmaneuver his opponents to become not only a warrior, but one of Japan's greatest military and civic leaders. Hideyoshi's timeless leadership secrets are destined to join such classics as The Book of Five Rings and The Art of War as practical techniques for success in business, conflict, and life.</p>
